# Welcome to the Fullstack Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

We're excited that you would like to be part of the team here at SponsorCX and we're excited to talk with you!  

## Introduction
Below, you'll find a repository with a simple React and Node.js application. The project is left open-ended for you to provide your unique solution to the problem. Please spend no more than 4 hours working on the challenge. 

The goal of the challenge is:
- Learn about your work & working style
- Introduce you to problems like the ones we work on at SponsorCX

> *Note: If you have a personal project that you believe better showcases your work that you can share and talk about with us, you can use that instead. It should demonstrate your ability to work from the backend to the frontend.*

## Background

At SponsorCX, we help `organizations` manage the sponsorships they have with their customers (e.g. `accounts`). For this challenge, we'll focus specifically on the `Deals` that an organization has with their various `accounts`.

### Organization
An `organization` is a company that has signed up to use our platform to manage their sponsorships.

### The Account
An `Account` is a company that a company has a potential sponsorship with.

### The Deal
A `Deal` is a contract between an `organization` and an `account`. It has a `start date`, an `end date`, a `value`and a `status`.

Organizations can have multiple `accounts` and `accounts` can have multiple `deals`. 

## The Challenges - 3.5 hours
SponsorCX organizations need a way to view all of their `deals` and how much they are worth. We have broken this into two challenges.

### Challenge 1
Add a page to the application that displays the `deals` and their total value. Build the api and react components to display the data. 

### Challenge 2
Organizations need to be able to filter the `deals` by `status` and `year`. Add this functionality to the api and frontend.
